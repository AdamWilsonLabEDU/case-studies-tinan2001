# Case Study Goal
## What is the full name of the destination airport -- Farthest from any of the NYC airports? -- Assign this value as "farthest_airport"


```{r Packages} 
library (tidyverse)
library (nycflights13)

flights <- flights
airlines <- airlines
planes <- planes
airports <- airports
weather <- weather
```

## Data Arragement 
Comments

```{r}
flight_dist_desc <- flights %>%
  select (origin, dest, distance) %>%
  filter (origin == "JFK" |origin == "EWR"| origin == "LGA") %>%
  arrange(desc(distance))

port_names <- airports %>%
  select (faa, name)

```
##Merging flights and airports
```{r}
mergeflights <- flight_dist_desc %>%
  left_join(port_names, c("dest" = "faa"))
```

##Output the farthest airport from any of the NYC airports
```{r}
print (farthest_airport <- mergeflights$name[1])

```
